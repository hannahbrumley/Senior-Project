# Wellness Wizards App (Senior Project)

A .NET MAUI application created as a Senior Project. This project is incomplete and was never finished — the repository contains UI pages and app scaffolding but some features remain unfinished or are placeholders.

## Summary
Wellness Wizards is an app prototype built with .NET MAUI (XAML + C#) that includes screens for login, main navigation, card/deck management, a web page view, and an about/admin area. It was developed as a Senior Project but was not completed.

## Status
- Project type: Senior Project (unfinished)
- Current state: UI and app structure largely implemented; full functionality, polishing, and persistence/back-end work are incomplete.

## Key features (what's present)
- LoginPage — UI for signing in (may be a placeholder).
- MainPage / AppShell — App navigation and shell.
- CardsPage / CardsDetailPage — Interfaces for viewing card lists and card details.
- CreateNewCardTemplate / CreateNewDeckTemplate — Screens to add cards and decks.
- InsertCard — UI for inserting cards into a deck.
- AboutPage, AdminShell, WebPage — Additional informational/admin and web view pages.

## Tech stack
- .NET MAUI (XAML + C#)
- Solution and project files: `Wellness Wizards App.sln` and `Wellness Wizards App.csproj`
- Built for cross-platform mobile/desktop via MAUI (see .csproj for target frameworks)

## Known gaps / next steps
- Authentication flow not completed — check LoginPage code.
- Data persistence or back-end integration is missing or incomplete (no dedicated API or DB project in this repo).
- Some UI pages may have placeholder content or incomplete logic.
- Tests and documentation are not present.
